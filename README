Version 1.0beta–
This is a minor rewrite of the original stacey application.
At the moment, all of the base functionality is working, but still needs some cleaning up and proper testing

Overview—
Stacey takes static content from .txt files, image files and directory structure and generates a static portfolio website. So, a no-cms, no-database, semi-dynamic website generator.
If you look in the /content and /templates folders, you should get the general idea of how it all works.
Or check out http://staceyapp.com for more detailed usage information.

Installation–
Copy to server, chmod 777 app/cache, rename htacess file to .htaccess.
