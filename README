Version 1.0beta–
This is a minor rewrite of the original stacey application.
At the moment, all of the base functionality is working, but still needs some proper testing behind it.
Any help beta testing would be much appreciated.

New stuff–
- You can now have rename and have multiple projects folders. Each page list can accessed within the templates as follows: #.folder-name => @Folder-name (obviously a little inconsistent at the moment)
- Ordering now works in reverse (10. is first, 9. is second, etc), this makes adding a new project to the top of the list 1,000,000 times easier
- The caching system now caches *anything* it regards as a file that can be changed by the user
- Images_Count renamed to Total_Images, Projects_Count renamed to Total_Projects
- .htaccess file is a lot cleaner

Overview—
Stacey takes static content from .txt files, image files and directory structure and generates a static portfolio website. So, a no-cms, no-database, semi-dynamic website generator.
If you look in the /content and /templates folders, you should get the general idea of how it all works.

Installation–
Copy to server, chmod 777 app/cache, rename htacess file to .htaccess.
