Overview—
Stacey takes static content from .txt files, image files and directory structure and generates a static portfolio website. So, a no-cms, no-database, semi-dynamic website generator.
If you look in the /content and /templates folders, you should get the general idea of how it all works.
Or check out http://staceyapp.com for more detailed usage information.

Installation–
Rename htacess file to .htaccess, copy to server.
