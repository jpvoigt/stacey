Overview—
Version 2
This is the first cut of the rewrite of the original app.
The focus is on extending the original concept to become useable as a simple site CMS.

v2.0RC is not yet ready for production, but shows the direction the application is heading in.
Feel free to check it the branch and hit me up with any thoughts or suggestions.

Big thanks to Ben Schwarz and Ian Yamey for their help pulling together concepts and code for this version.
