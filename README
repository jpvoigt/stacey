Version 1.0b–
This is a minor rewrite of the original stacey application.
At the moment, all of the base functionality is working, but still needs some proper testing behind it.
Any help beta testing would be much appreciated.

New stuff–
- The concept of Pages and Projects have been replaced with Pages, Categories and PageInCategories
- You can now rename and have multiple projects folders. Each list can accessed within the templates as follows: #.folder-name => @Folder_Name or #.folder => @Folder
	- There is also a fallback template-finding system:
		Using the @Folder var will first look for '/templates/partials/folder.html', failing that it will fall back to using '/templates/partials/category-list.html'
- Templates are now selected by the name of the text file (ie. /folder/page/project.txt will look for /templates/project.html as it's template)
	Fallbacks:
		Page => /templates/content.html
		Category => /templates/category.html
		PageInCategory => /templates/page-in-category.html
- Ordering now works in reverse (10. is first, 9. is second, etc), this makes adding a new project to the top of the list 1,000,000 times easier
- The caching system now caches *anything* it regards as a file that can be changed by the user
- .htaccess file is a lot cleaner
- @Images_Count renamed to @Total_Images, @Projects_Count renamed to @Total_Projects
- /templates/partials/next-project.html renamed to /templates/partials/next-page.html, var is now @Next_Page
- /templates/partials/previous-project.html renamed to /templates/partials/previous-page.html, var is now @Previous_Page

This is a bit of a brain dump, so I may have missed some things.

Overview—
Stacey takes static content from .txt files, image files and directory structure and generates a static portfolio website. So, a no-cms, no-database, semi-dynamic website generator.
If you look in the /content and /templates folders, you should get the general idea of how it all works.

Installation–
Copy to server, chmod 777 app/cache, rename htacess file to .htaccess.
